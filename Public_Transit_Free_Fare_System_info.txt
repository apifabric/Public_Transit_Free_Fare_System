design a website application for the city of Edmonton that will allow citizens to register for free use of the city's transport buses and wheelchair transport services.  the system would allow a citizen to register their name and address and then select from a range of options that would allow them to qualify for the free travel.  there would be a range of qualifying reasons, such as disabled person, elderly person, military veteran, etc.  another element of the qualification would be the household income level and they would only qualify if the level is below a set threshold.
